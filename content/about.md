## Hello.

My name is Charles Allhands. I currently work for the University of Wisconsin - Madison College of Engineering [TEAM Lab](https://teamlab.engr.wisc.edu/). I'm also a volunteer EMT for the [Village of McFarland](http://www.mcfarland.wi.us/firerescue). When I'm not doing those things I'm fiddling with computers and radios, building things, pestering honey bees, or camping somewhere ([preferably](https://www.nps.gov/olym/index.htm) [with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji) [mountains](https://www.nps.gov/glac/index.htm)). You can contact me using the email link in the upper right corner above.

## Amateur Radio

My call sign is AC9BL and I live in Madison, WI (EN53). I got my first call sign (KC9TTE) in March of 2011. By the following March I got my extra class license and I’ve been on the air ever since.

### Equipment

* Kenwood TS–480SAT (20-meter dipole antenna, >100 watts @ ~15’)
* Yaesu FT–7900R (mag-mount 144&#47;440 antenna, >50&#47;40 watts @ ~6')
* Kenwood TH-D72A
* MD-380 running [md380tools](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools) 
* Airspy SDR
* R820T SDR

### APRS

Sometimes I beacon my location on APRS. When I do it should show up here (otherwise it just shows Helsinki).
<p>
<script type="text/javascript">
	he_track = "AC9BL"; // track this callsign
	// latitude and longitude of Madison, Wisconsin
	he_lat = 243.0748;
	he_lng = -89.3838;
	he_zoom = 10; // zoom out a bit
</script>

## Beekeeping

I keep a handful of colonies of honeybees. I don't do it out of some misplaced sense of trying to save the world, I just think they're neat.
